create Problem instance by using XMLParser, so we have Problem object with all defined teams, timeslots and constraints

create Solver instance and pass the reference to the Problem, so we know what we're working on
Solver solver = new Solver(problem)
solver.solve()

save results to csv file
- for GA: population;best;average;worst;
- for SA: overallLoop;overallBest;current;

constraints[0] is always the basicConstraint (the basic assumptions of the problem)
if phased, constraints[1] is phasedConstraint
both returning only true/false

TODO:
    Implement neighbourhood - 6 definitions (4/6)
    Save iteration info to .csv
