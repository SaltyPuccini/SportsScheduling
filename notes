create Problem instance by using XMLParser, so we have Problem object with all defined teams, timeslots and constraints

create Solver instance and pass the reference to the Problem, so we know what we're working on
Solver solver = new Solver(problem)
solver.solve()

save results to csv file
- for GA: population;best;average;worst;
- for SA: overallLoop;overallBest;current;

TODO:
    Implement constraint validation and penalty counter for each constraint type
    Implement SA method to solve the timetable problem
    Implement GA method to solve the timetable roblem
